# **Embedded C - Core Concepts**

## **1. Basics of Embedded C**

### **Q1: What is the difference between Embedded C and Standard C?**
**Answer:**
- Standard C is a general-purpose programming language used for various applications.
- Embedded C is a specialized version of C tailored for programming microcontrollers and embedded systems.
- Embedded C provides direct access to hardware, whereas Standard C runs on general-purpose computers.
- Example:
  ```c
  // Standard C
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main() {
      printf("Hello, World!\n");
      return 0;
  }
  
  // Embedded C
  #include <avr/io.h>
  int main() {
      DDRB |= (1 << PB0); // Set PB0 as output
      PORTB |= (1 << PB0); // Turn LED on
      return 0;
  }
  ```

### **Q2: What are volatile and const volatile qualifiers in C?**
**Answer:**
- `volatile`: Prevents compiler optimization of a variable that can change outside program flow.
- `const volatile`: A read-only variable that can change due to hardware updates.
- Example:
  ```c
  volatile int sensor_value; // Prevents compiler optimization
  const volatile int *status_reg = (int*) 0x40021000; // Hardware status register
  ```

### **Q3: How do you optimize embedded C code for memory and performance?**
**Answer:**
- Use `inline` functions instead of macros.
- Avoid dynamic memory allocation (`malloc/free`).
- Use bitwise operations for efficiency.
- Minimize ISR execution time.
- Example:
  ```c
  inline int multiply_by_two(int x) {
      return x << 1; // Faster than x*2
  }
  ```

## **2. Memory Management**

### **Q4: What are static, stack, and heap memory allocations?**
**Answer:**
- **Static Memory**: Allocated at compile-time, exists throughout program execution.
- **Stack Memory**: Used for function calls, limited size, fast access.
- **Heap Memory**: Dynamically allocated, but slower and prone to fragmentation.
- Example:
  ```c
  int global_var; // Static
  void function() {
      int local_var; // Stack
      int *ptr = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int)); // Heap
  }
  ```

### **Q5: Why is dynamic memory allocation discouraged in embedded systems?**
**Answer:**
- Unpredictable execution time.
- Memory fragmentation.
- Risk of memory leaks.

## **3. Interrupts & Timers**

### **Q6: What is an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) and its constraints?**
**Answer:**
- ISR is a function executed when an interrupt occurs.
- Constraints:
  - Should be short and fast.
  - Should not use `printf()` or `malloc()`.
  - Must use `volatile` for shared variables.
- Example:
  ```c
  ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect) {
      PORTB ^= (1 << PB0); // Toggle LED
  }
  ```

### **Q7: What is a watchdog timer?**
**Answer:**
- A hardware timer that resets the system if the software becomes unresponsive.
- Example:
  ```c
  WDTCSR |= (1 << WDE); // Enable watchdog timer
  ```

## **4. Embedded C++ - Object-Oriented Programming**

### **Q8: What are the main differences between Embedded C and Embedded C++?**
**Answer:**
- Embedded C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes and inheritance.
- C++ supports function overloading, whereas C does not.
- C++ has better type safety and encapsulation.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  class LED {
  public:
      void turnOn() { PORTB |= (1 << PB0); }
      void turnOff() { PORTB &= ~(1 << PB0); }
  };
  ```

### **Q9: What is the role of constructors and destructors in Embedded C++?**
**Answer:**
- **Constructor**: Initializes an object when it is created.
- **Destructor**: Cleans up resources when an object goes out of scope.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  class Motor {
  public:
      Motor() { initializeMotor(); }
      ~Motor() { stopMotor(); }
  private:
      void initializeMotor() { /* setup code */ }
      void stopMotor() { /* cleanup code */ }
  };
  ```

### **Q10: How does Embedded C++ handle memory management?**
**Answer:**
- Avoids `new` and `delete` due to dynamic memory risks.
- Uses `static` objects where possible.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  class Sensor {
      static int calibrationData;
  };
  ```
